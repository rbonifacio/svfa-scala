# SVFA (Sparse Value Flow Analysis) implementation based on Soot

This is a scala implementation of a framework that builds a sparse-value flow graph using Soot.

## Status

   * experimental

## Usage

   * clone this repository or download an stable release
   * build this project using sbt (`sbt compile test`)
   * publish the artifact as a JAR file in your m2 repository (`sbt publish`)
   * create a dependency to the svfa-scala artifact in your maven project. 

```{xml}
<dependency>	
  <groupId>br.unb.cic</groupId>
  <artifactId>svfa-scala_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>
```

   * implement a class that extends the `JSVFA class` (see some examples in the scala tests). you must provide implementations to the following methods
      * `getEntryPoints()` to set up the "main" methods. This implementation must return a list of Soot methods
      * `sootClassPath()` to set up the soot classpath. This implementation must return a string
      * `analyze(unit)` to identify the type of a node  (source, sink, simple node) in the graph; given a statement (soot unit)
